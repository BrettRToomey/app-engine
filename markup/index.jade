            Government has failed us. More than 90% of Americans link that
            failure to the influence of money in politics.

          p Yet the politicians ignore this influence. While America founders, they spend endless time with their funders.

          p These funders hold our democracy hostage. <u>We want to pay the ransom, and get it back.</u>

            strong We're going to kickstart a SuperPAC big enough to make it possible to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016.

          p Or at least we're going to try.

          p This Citizens' SuperPAC will be funded through a series of contingent pledges:

          p.indented We will set funding goals.

          p.indented We will only collect if we hit our goals.

          p The idea is simple: Unless there’s enough to make a difference, you don’t pay.

          p In 2014, we want to make fundamental reform the issue in 5 congressional races.

          p From that, we'll have a better sense of what victory in 2016 will take. And we'll put Congress on notice that in 2016, we'll be back.

          p So for 2014, we have two fundraising targets:

          p.indented.strong The first is $1 million by the end of May. If we meet that goal, that $1 million will be matched, and we'll move to the second target.

          p.indented.strong That second target is $5 million by the end of June. If we meet that goal, that $5 million will also be matched, and our fundraising for 2014 will end.

          p We will then have the funds we need to hire the best campaign shops we can to use 100% of these kickstarted funds to win in these 5 districts.

          p Over the past year, we have been calculating what it would cost to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016. We have a good sense of the range, and of which seats would need to change.

          p Our experience in 2014 will give us a better sense. And based on what we learn, we will decide whether this moonshot is feasible.

          p If it is, in January 2015, we will launch the second round of the Mayday PAC, crowdfunding small-dollar contributions again from citizens up, and larger contributions from wealthy citizens down.

          p Based on what we know now, we believe this <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2014/04/25/lawrence-lessig-has-a-moonshot-plan-to-halt-our-slide-toward-plutocracy/">moonshot</a> is possible. Based on what we achieve in 2014, others will believe it as well.
