Dear {name},

Thank you for your pledge. Please help spread the word however you can, and stay tuned for information about our “Mayday First Responder” schwag. 

Please share our campaign through social media, tell your friends, family, co-workers, and neighbors, call in to your local radio shows and write letters to your local editors.  Or if you wish, buy a full page advert in the New York Times. (Up to you...)

We'll be working on ways to help spread the message as well, and we would love for you to share your ideas about how to do so with us through the #MayOne hashtag, our Facebook Page[1], or @MayOneUS[2] on Twitter.  

If you need to track your pledge, you can {receipt_link} 

Thanks again, 

Lessig
